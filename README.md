# Dells Food Finder
A full stack app that will scratch an itch for my girlfriend and myself. 

It will pull in a listing of restaurants in Wisconsin Dells and randomly pick one to go to!

Currently implemented:
    * Use knex to create and seed a database populated with data from the Google Places API 
    * API Endpoint to retrieve list of restaurants from database

This project is a work-in-progress
